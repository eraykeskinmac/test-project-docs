# Installation

This guide covers different installation methods for the project.

## Using npm

The recommended way to install is using npm:

npm install your-package
```

## Using yarn

If you prefer yarn:

```bash
yarn add your-package
```

## Using pnpm

For pnpm users:

```bash
pnpm add your-package
```

## From Source

You can also install from the GitHub repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
cd repo
npm install
npm run build
```

## Verify Installation

After installation, verify everything works:

```typescript
import { version } from 'your-package';
console.log('Version:', version);
```
